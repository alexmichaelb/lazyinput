Automatic swiping for tinder to boost a hidden score nicknamed "elo". Regular swipes, a balance of left and right swipes, as well as who you're swiping and who is swiping you back affect elo.

Repetitive key inputs in different variations to produce different results, in turn affecting your tinder elo with basic TKinter GUI.

There are three different settings-
-Calm
-Optimal
-Hyper

Note: Hyper may get you banned if it is on for too long.
